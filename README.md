# gopter_example
Example usage of Gopter, a property-based testing library for Go. I am very interested in property-based testing, and this is my attempt to learn a bit about [Gopter](https://github.com/leanovate/gopter) which is a property-based testing library for Go.

This repository is just a collection of random functions and their property-based tests.
